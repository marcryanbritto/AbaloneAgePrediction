        "- The physical measurements of abalones (such as length, diameter, and weight) can be used to accurately estimate their age without the need for the laborious and time-consuming ring counting method. This has important implications for the management and conservation of abalone populations, as it provides a more efficient and cost-effective way to estimate their age and track changes in population demographics over time. But we the accuracy is very low.\n",
        "- It is important to note that predicting the age of abalones from their physical measurements may require additional information, such as weather patterns and location, in order to achieve the highest possible accuracy. Therefore, future research should continue to explore and refine the predictive models for estimating the age of abalones using both physical measurements and environmental variables.\n",
